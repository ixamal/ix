# Crate identity repair

`stems` writes STEM siblings. [music_migration](https://github.com/ixamal/music_migration) remaps Traktor/Rekordbox after files move. **This package** started as identity repair in `~/Music/stems_audio` and grew into the Music.app crate toolkit: relink, pull a migration home, promote leftover genres, drop ghosts, un-break WAVs, STEMIT.

Audio never enters git. Reports and lookup cache: `~/local_tools/crate/`. Steal the ideas: README *Crate toolkit*. Do not copy our `/Users` paths.

## Cascade (every family)

1. **Filename** — `Artist - Title` or `Artist - Album - Title`, junk stripped. `Artist _ Title` and `Artist | Title` only when the left side is ≤4 words.
2. **Tags** — mix-file tags only; ignore role-file `instrumental` / `vocals`.
3. **iTunes + Deezer** — title + duration (or both catalogs agree). Mashups, clips, and mixes ≥20 min stay out.
4. **MusicBrainz** — fill album only when artist is already known.
5. **Ollama** — `127.0.0.1:11434` JSON. Default `qwen2.5:7b`. Coder models are skipped. Artist must appear in the filename.
6. **`Compilations/Mashups/Miscellaneous/`** — leftover bucket after lookup. Never `Unknown Artist` / `Unknown Album`. Scan still starts from `_outliers/Inbox/`.

No skips. Families (mix + stem + vocals/instrumental) always move together.

Mashups: `Compilations/Mashups/{Artist}/`. Also moves `{Artist}/Mashups/` and placeholder albums (`Unknown Album`, `_ album title goes here _`). Artist description is the parent folder name.

## After this dump

Unknown Album, mashups, and Inbox are executed. `_outliers` is gone. Unidentified leftovers: `Compilations/Mashups/Miscellaneous/`.

1. Traktor remapped. DJCU2 confirmed. Path-stable crate confirmed (TODO 3).
2. Genre pass done (TODO 4): owned `Media.localized` tags + Music.app library. See `docs/onetagger.md`.

Do not casually move Apple Music `Media.localized`. The named mover is `music-organize` (dry-run first; remap Traktor / Rekordbox after). In-place genre on owned `.mp3`/`.m4a` was TODO 4 only. Never commit `/Users/<name>/` paths.

## Music.app media folder

Copy-on-add is the default and it works. Drag Beatport / Traxsource files onto Music.app.

The library media folder is `~/Music/Music/Media.localized`. The DJ crate already lives as **Artist / Album** folders at that root (Traktor and Rekordbox point there). New copies from Music.app go into a real subdirectory:

`Media.localized/Music/Artist/Album/file`

Do **not** turn `Media.localized/Music` into a symlink to `.`. That leftover iTunes loop made drag-and-drop fail with **Attempting to copy to the disk “Data” failed. A duplicate file name was specified.** (“Data” is the APFS user volume, not a second disk.) Replaced with a real `Music/` folder 2026-09-03; Traxsource drag-and-drop confirmed.

Removing the loop had a cost that was not caught the same day. 7,110 rows had been written while it existed, so they record `Media.localized/Music/Artist/...` for a file that actually sits at `Media.localized/Artist/...`. The loop made both spellings resolve; a real folder does not. 5,368 rows went to **!** immediately. `music-reconcile` repaired them by pointing each row at the real path, so the library no longer depends on the loop existing.

Leave **Sync Library** Off. Leave **Keep Music Media folder organized** Off — that switch would dump the artist-root crate into `Music/` and break the path-stable Traktor / Rekordbox crate. `music-organize` is how files get Artist / Album / `NN Title` names without hoisting. Do not hoist new `Music/` files up onto the artist-root crate. Do not delete `Music/` to “flatten” the library. `music-repair` indexes both trees and skips `Music/` as an artist name.

## music-reconcile

`music-repair` matches a dead row by artist/title against what is on disk, which only lands when the title is unique. `music-reconcile` starts from `Media.localized/iTunes Music Library.xml` instead: it records **persistent ID → path**, and the live library still uses those same IDs. That turns a guess into an exact per-row lookup.

For each row Music.app reports as `missing value`, in order:

1. the path the XML recorded, if that file is still there
2. the same path with the `Music/` container removed (the symlink fallout above)
3. the same path rebased onto a backup `Media.localized` root (`--external`)
4. artist/title match over a wider external tree (`--external-scan`)

A candidate is only used when no live row already holds it, so a relink can never mint a duplicate. Rows whose file is already claimed are reported as `duplicate_rows` and left for `music-dupes`.

Two things about reading the library that cost a day:

- Read `location` in **bulk** (`location of file tracks i thru j`). The per-track form inside a repeat fails to coerce on this library and reports every row as dead — that is where the bogus "14,127 missing" first came from.
- Relinking **reorders** `library playlist 1`, so a position captured during the scan goes stale mid-run. Each write re-checks the persistent ID at that index and skips on mismatch, and `--passes` re-scans until it converges. The first single-pass run relinked 7,580 and skipped 5,536 purely from drift.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate music-reconcile            # dry-run
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate music-reconcile --execute  # relink, re-scanning until stable
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate music-reconcile \
  --external     "/Volumes/<drive>/MIGRATION_MASTER/Music/Music/Media.localized" \
  --external-scan "/Volumes/<drive>/MIGRATION_MASTER/Music"
```

2026-09-03: **8,748 → 21,850** rows holding a file (13,102 relinked, 7,748 at their recorded path, 5,368 hoisted out of `Music/`). Then `consolidate` brought the crate back local and a second pass with `--external-scan ~/Music/Music/Media.localized` relinked 291 more.

**22,173 of 22,873 rows now resolve, all under `~/Music`. No row points at `/Volumes`.** After `music-genre` and `music-replicants` (2026-09-04): **22,251** file tracks. After Terrarum recover + `music-cull`: **21,824** file tracks, **0** leftover `!` / unreadable rows. No leftover `EDM,` genre.

Never relink to a removable volume. Those rows go **!** again the moment it unmounts. Copy in first with `consolidate`, then relink against the local tree.

## consolidate

An earlier migration moved audio out of `~` onto Terrarum. That is the root cause of the library rows with no file, and the reason the crate has to be pulled back rather than merely relinked.

`consolidate` walks a source tree, drops what is already held locally, and files the rest under `~/Music` as **Artist / Album**.

**Tags decide the destination, not source paths.** The exFAT copy truncated long filenames and rewrote `/` as `_` (`08 Head Affect _ Afrochrome [Gent.mp3`), so the source layout cannot be trusted, but the tags survived. Untagged audio falls back to the folders around it, ignoring containers that say nothing about who made it (`Desktop`, `Documents`, `Downloads`, `Library`, `CloudStorage`). Separator output named for the role alone (`vocals.wav`) is routed to `stems_audio` keeping its project folder as the album — otherwise thousands of identically named files pile into one directory.

Duplicate test is exact byte size plus normalized title, confirmed by hashing the leading 4MB only when a pair ties. Size alone collides across encodes of the same length, title alone collides across compilations. Both the tag title and the filename title count, because truncation makes them disagree. iTunes names a second copy `Track 1.m4a`; that trailing marker is stripped from the title key so a held track is not copied in again.

Copy only. Sources are never moved or deleted, existing files are never overwritten, a colliding name gets a numbered suffix, and each file lands via a size-checked `.partial`. A run is repeatable and safe to interrupt.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate consolidate "/Volumes/<drive>/<path>" --index-cache ~/local_tools/crate/local-audio-index.json
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate consolidate "/Volumes/<drive>/<path>" --index-cache ~/local_tools/crate/local-audio-index.json --execute
```

`--index-cache` is worth passing. Reading tags across the whole local library takes about half an hour, and the cache makes it reusable — but **delete it after copying**, or the next run will still believe the new files are absent.

2026-09-03: 26,640 scanned, 790 already held, **22,457 copied (273 GB)**. The run then stopped: Terrarum unmounted mid-copy and the remaining 3,393 all failed on a vanished source. `consolidate` now tells a lost volume apart from one unreadable file and stops on the first rather than reporting one problem 3,393 times.

## music-genre

The 2026-08-30 OneTagger pass (`docs/onetagger.md`) cleared `EDM, …` from the crate. Consolidating the migration drive brought the spelling back on tracks that had never been through that pass.

`music-genre` strips a leading `EDM,` only (`EDM, House` → `House`, `EDM, House, Deep` → `House, Deep`). Slash store spellings (`Funk / Soul / Disco`, `Electronica / Downtempo`) are left alone. Music.app does **not** re-read file tags, so the write is two-layer: mutagen on owned `.mp3` / `.m4a` (never `.m4p` or WAV/AIFF — ID3 prepends and breaks RIFF), then AppleScript `set genre` on the library row. `--passes` re-scans because editing a row can reorder `library playlist 1`. Click off a stale genre selection in the column browser after a run.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate music-genre
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate music-genre --execute
```

2026-09-04: **229** rows (182 `EDM, House` → `House`, 23 Ambient, 20 Electronica, 4 `House, Deep`). File tags 229, library rows 229, leftover `EDM*`: **0**.

Same day, after the Terrarum recover: **66** more (42 House, 13 Electronica, 9 Ambient, 1 `House, Deep`, 1 `Electronica / Downtempo`). Those copies still wore the old prefix; Music.app showed it when the rows came back. Leftover `EDM*`: **0**.

## music-replicants

`music-dupes` groups rows by path. It cannot see the other shape: two rows, two files, identical audio. iTunes writes a second copy as `Track 1.m4a`, and `consolidate` added more of those until the title key learned the marker.

`music-replicants` groups by artist/album/title, then compares **decoded** audio (ffmpeg mono 22 kHz MD5). Tag bytes on a re-saved `.m4a` differ while the recording does not; a raw-byte test called hundreds of real twins distinct. DRM that will not decode falls back to leading bytes. A group that disagrees is left alone — alternate takes share a title legitimately. Playlist membership wins the keeper so a crate slot is never emptied. Deleting an extra row may bin that row's own file; the kept copy is re-checked after every delete and the run stops if it vanished.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate music-replicants
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate music-replicants --execute
```

2026-09-04: **476** extra rows dropped (decoded-audio twins) plus **146** same-file extras via `music-dupes`. Remaining same-title groups are different audio (left). The dead `!` rows next to them were later culled.

## music-cull

Terrarum `MIGRATION_MASTER` has been searched. Rows that are still `!` and not on that drive stay off the hunt. `music-cull` drops the Music.app row when the location is empty, the path is not a file, or the file is unreadable (empty, or a WAV/AIFF that no longer starts with RIFF/FORM). Valid files stay. `.m4p` purchases stay even if ffmpeg cannot decode them. Dry-run is the default.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate music-cull
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate music-cull --execute
```

2026-09-04: **425** rows dropped (424 empty location, 1 leftover `.itlp`). **0** corrupt WAV/AIFF on disk. Library **21,824** file tracks, leftover drop **0**. What is not on Terrarum is a later hunt, not a Music.app ghost.

## music-organize

`music-fix` writes artist / album / title into Music.app. It does not rename the file. That is why Songs can say Moby / Play / Honey while `ls` still shows `Track 01.m4a`. DJ software and a zsh listing see the disc name.

`music-organize` is file management for that gap. Music.app metadata is the source of truth:

* folder = album artist (else artist) / album (or `Singles`)
* file = `NN Title` when the library has a track number, else `Title`
* stay in the tree you already live in (`Media.localized/Artist/…` or `Media.localized/Music/Artist/…`). Never hoist.
* a real filename stays (Beatport `Artist - Title` is only *moved* if the folder is wrong)
* `Track 01` is renamed only when Music.app already has a real title. No metadata, no rename.
* never overwrite, never touch `.stem.m4a` / `.m4p`
* a cut already under `Compilations/` stays there unless Music.app has a real album artist (the DJ). Track artist alone must not explode a mix CD.
* a Compilations / Various Artists album that would split across dest artists stays put.
* folder moves inside `Media.localized/Music/` do not stick. Music.app restores the old path and deletes the dest. Artist-root crate can move; copy-on-add then pulls those files into `Music/`.

Keep **Keep Music Media folder organized** Off. That switch would reshuffle the artist-root crate into `Music/` and break path-stable Traktor / Rekordbox. This command organizes in place and writes `remaps[]` in `~/local_tools/crate/reports/music-organize-*.json` for [music_migration](https://github.com/ixamal/music_migration).

`--placeholders-only` renames `Track 01` junk and leaves folder-only moves. Playlist `Fix` is gone. Dry-run the library first.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate music-organize
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate music-organize --placeholders-only
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate music-organize --placeholders-only --execute
```

2026-09-06: first dry-run wanted **6,818** folder moves — mostly `Compilations/` → per-cut track artist (would smash GU / mix CDs). Compilations stay unless album artist is the DJ; split compilations stay together. **17** `Track 01` files renamed (`--placeholders-only`). Second pass: **606** artist-root tracks now play from `Media.localized/Music/Artist/Album` (copy-on-add). **472** files already in the `Music/` tree did not move — Music.app restores that path if you rename out of it. All **1,078** Songs rows still have a file (`location as alias`). Report `~/local_tools/crate/reports/music-organize-20260906T183808Z.json`. Remaps for the 606: Rekordbox XML **539** + Collection **38** applied 2026-09-06. Traktor **561** wait in `~/local_tools/crate/reports/collection.nml.organize-606` (quit Traktor before swapping). Leftover junk with tags/filename identity: **51** added to Music.app.

## riff-repair

`music-fix` / EasyID3 wrote `ID3` onto `.wav` files. That is where `RIFF` belongs, so Music.app and ffmpeg refuse the file (*invalid start code ID3[3]*). `consolidate` then copied the still-valid Terrarum original in as `Track (2).wav` (and later `(3)`) because the bloated corrupt file no longer matched on size.

`riff-repair` walks a folder (default `Media.localized`, recursive), groups `Name.wav` / `Name (2).wav`, keeps the unnumbered name, copies a valid RIFF (local sibling or `--source`) over the corrupt keeper, and deletes extras only when decoded audio matches. Music.app rows that pointed at a deleted `(2)` / `(3)` are relinked to the keeper. Dry-run is the default. The tag writers now skip WAV/AIFF entirely (`RIFF_NO_ID3`).

```bash
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate riff-repair
PYTHONPATH=crate python3 -m ix_crate riff-repair --execute
```

2026-09-04: library-wide pass on `Media.localized` — **699** `.wav`, all `RIFF`, **0** ID3-headed leftovers, **0** leftover `(2)` / `(3)` groups.

## STEMIT

Name for the local stem factory job: Music.app playlist → hardlink the mix into `~/Music/stems_audio/Artist/Album/` → [ixamal/stems](https://github.com/ixamal/stems) `py.exec.separate` as the RUNBOOK does (`PATH` = stems `.venv/bin` first, then that venv’s `python -m py.exec.separate`). Mel vocals/instrumental + `{name}.stem.m4a`. Aqua HUD is `py.utils.progress`. Homebrew Python 3.12 `.venv` in the stems repo. ~3.8 min/track. `audio-separator` lives in that venv — do not call the factory with system PATH.

Never write Apple Music. Acapellas stay in `stems_audio`. `--sync-playlists` works in any state — factory or not. It walks `stems_audio` and rewrites Traktor + Rekordbox crates **Mixes / Stems / Acapellas / Instrumentals**. Mixes is the hardlink / parallel original. Files not yet in the collection get a location row so the crate exists before Import / Analyze. Analyze stays in-app. `--fix-role-titles` writes a real title onto factory `.mp3` / `.m4a` pairs whose tag is `vocals` / `instrumental` (filename, mix sibling, or IndustryStems folder — not MusicBrainz, not OneTagger). Never mutagen-write `.wav` or `.stem.m4a`. After tags: quit Traktor, `--fix-role-titles --nml --execute`, reopen Traktor, then **DJCU2** to Rekordbox (`docs/djcu2.md`). Do not rewrite `rekordbox.xml` for this pass. `--fix-industry-artists` fills artist on Industry Stems packs from the crate (then iTunes leftovers), patches Traktor NML ARTIST (never WAV tags), and keeps one STEMIT playlist row per identity. `--genres` applies the same `EDM, …` / `House, …` cleanup as `music-genre` to STEMIT NML INFO GENRE (keepers plus leftover collection rows), then rebuilds `STEMIT/Genres/<Genre>/{Mixes,Stems,Acapellas,Instrumentals}` from crate keepers. Safe to re-run after adds or copies. Never mutagen-writes `.wav` / `.stem.m4a`. `--dedupe` then deletes confirmed copies from Finder (Mashups dumps, Unknown Album, same-audio twins) and rebuilds crates. Unique mashups and Industry Stems WAV packs stay. Never ffmpeg-decode `.stem.m4a`. Specimens: `docs/examples/stemit-industry-artists.py`, `docs/examples/music-set-industry-artist.applescript`. `traktor-nml` drops duplicate playlist PRIMARYKEYs, copies sibling COVERARTID when the Coverart cache file exists, and drops Finder `(2)` copies when mutagen length matches and decoded audio is identical, then rewrites STEMIT crates from disk. Mix / stem / vocals / instrumental are four files, not copies. Never stem **Acapella**. Skip if that dest already has `{name}.stem.m4a`. Dry-run unless `--execute`. Queue m3u + reports: `~/local_tools/crate/` (off git).

The mix is a **hardlink**, not a copy: one set of bytes, two paths (Apple Music + `stems_audio`). Deleting the `stems_audio` name never deletes the Apple Music file.

First run, 2026-09-03 — Music playlist `Never Forget 50th v01`, **21 tracks**: 21 `.stem.m4a`, 20 full Rekordbox pairs, 42/42 factory writes, **0 fail**, 1.50 GB, **78 min** (3.7 min/track, ~38 s per audio minute). Lords Of Acid *Undress and Possess* hit `we found none` — Mel found no separable vocal, so **both** pair files dropped and the container still muxed. That is correct: the mix already is the instrumental.

The shell can look like it ran for hours after the batch ends — the Aqua HUD stays open until **Close**. Read `summary.wall_s_total` in the run JSON for real time, not shell elapsed.

`music-dupes` only deletes extra Music.app *rows* that share one existing file. It does not unlink audio. If a delete would trash the file, it restores from Trash and stops.

`music-repair` relinks Songs rows with no file (the Locate / ! mark) to a unique match under Media.localized. It does not move Apple Music files. Empty artist/album/title uses the crate cascade. Empty genre uses iTunes only.

`music-fix` fills identity on a playlist (default `Fix`). Default is **aggressive**: Chromaprint/AcoustID, duration-matched iTunes or Deezer, MusicBrainz length match, then **Shazam** (`shazamio` in `~/local_tools/crate/shazam-venv`; optional `songrec`) for cuts catalogs missed. Unidentified leftovers stay as they are — crate does **not** salvage them as Various Artists. `--library-va` scans the library artist instead of a playlist. `--strict` is dual-catalog only. Gaps only unless `--all`. Cream Live album stays. Dump folders become `Singles` when a real artist is found. Hits write album artist and clear the compilation flag so Apple Music files them under the artist, not Various Artists. In-place tags on owned audio. Disk names are `music-organize`, not this command. The crate CLI never Discogs-blasts. Beets is not used (`docs/notes.md`).

## Screenshot compilations

Batch fingerprinting (TODO 21) cannot fix a mix CD that already has *wrong* artists (every cut tagged as the DJ). When David sends a screenshot of one album:

1. Identify **that** release on Discogs / iTunes / Wikipedia. One compilation at a time. Do not walk the library.
2. Strip leading `01 ` / `02 ` from **titles**. Mix-CD `01 Artist` in the **artist** field is the same junk — keep real numbered names (16 Bit Lolitas, 28 East Boyz, 51 Days, 68 Beats, 95 North).
3. Write the liner/Discogs track artist. Album artist is the DJ or series brand (Tenaglia, Farina, Lazy Dog), not Various Artists and not a guess from another screenshot. Compilation **off** so the album stays under that album artist.
4. Unify name variants (`Vol. 2` vs `Volume 2`, `[Disc 1]` vs `(Disc 1)`) onto one album + disc numbers. Drop extra Music.app **rows** only — never unlink audio, never move `Media.localized`.
5. Prefer the row that still has a file. If the keeper is a Locate `!`, re-add the rip (`Music add POSIX file`) and delete the empty row. AppleScript `POSIX path of location` often lies on these files; `location as text` (HFS) is the check.
6. After a large write, Music.app may need a quit/reopen before Next follows disc/track order. Shuffle in the transport is independent of tags.

Reports and lookup cache stay in `~/local_tools/crate/` (off git).
